# PuTTYTray Configuration File with Monokai color Scheme
Create a folder named sessions and put this file in as "Default%20Settings", and on Putty select "Sessions from file".
For the color just copy "Color_only.txt" content to your configuration file replacing the existing one.
The color used is from the Sublime text 2 default style.
